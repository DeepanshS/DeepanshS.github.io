At $^{29}$Si natural abundance levels the $J_\\text{Si-O-Si}$ coupling splittings appear as overlapping doublet patterns arising from isolated $^{29}$Si−O−$^{29}$Si linkages. The experimental 2D J-resolved spectrum is analyzed to obtain a bivariate probability distribution correlating the central Si-O-Si angle of a Q4−Q4 linkage to its mean Si-O-Si angle (seven angles) using relationships between $^{29}$Si isotropic chemical shifts and geminal $J$ SiO-Si coupling of a Q4−Q4 to its local structure. To obtain a self-consistent bivariate probability distribution it was necessary to introduce an additional dependence of the $^{29}$Si chemical shift of a Q4 on mean Si-O distance as well as mean Si-O-Si angle. The implication of this necessary modification is a positive correlation between Si-O-Si angle and Si-O distance in the silica glass, consistent with recent $^{17}$O NMR measurements on ambient and densified silica glasses but running opposite to the trend generally found in crystalline silica polymorphs. From the analysis of the $^{29}$Si 2D J-resolved spectrum we determine a Si-O-Si bond angle distribution in silica glass as having a mean at $147.8^\\circ$, a mode at $147^\\circ$, and a standard deviation of $10.7^\\circ$. Our statistical model for analyzing the experimental $^{29}$Si 2D $J$-resolved spectrum also indicates that the individual Si-O-Si bond angle distributions are relatively uncorrelated.","tags":["NMR","silica glass","29Si NMR","Si-O-Si","J-couplings"],"title":"Correlating structural distributions in silica glass with two-dimensional $J$-resolved spectroscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deepansh Srivastava","Pierre Florian","Jay H.

For CO2 and N2 separation, much research has focused on faujasitic (FAU) membranes. Simulations suggest that chabazite (CHA) membranes can also be good at CO2 and N2 separation. In this study, we have focused on CHA membranes grown on porous polymeric polyethersulfone (PES) supports. Recently, we have reported on a dehydration rehydration hydrothermal (DRHT) process for FAU membrane growth on PES supports, which results in rapid crystallization. It is well known that FAU can be converted to CHA by an interzeolite conversion method, and is our choice for CHA synthesis in this study. A synthesis method for isolated CHA nanocrystals with size of 50–100 nm is reported. Rapid DRHT-based CHA powder synthesis and CHA/PES membrane growth are also being reported, all made by the interzeolite conversion of FAU. The CHA/PES membranes of ∼4 μm thickness were coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and at 25 °C, CO2 permeance of 1243 GPU with CO2/N2 selectivity of 19 was observed. The porosity of the PES support was critical to enhancing the formation and stability of the CHA membrane, since the CHA membrane on the PES surface was bonded to interconnected CHA crystals that grew within the PES from the seed crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Synthesis of chabazite/polymer composite membrane for $\\text{CO}_2$/$\\text{N}_2$ separation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deepansh Srivastava","Ramesh Ramachandran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380499200,"objectID":"0dd5b0ac39124b270654ab011a52f7d9","permalink":"https://DeepanshS.github.io/publication/3/","publishdate":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/3/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, a simple heuristic approach that is in agreement with the density operator formalism is presented for understanding the mechanism of multi-quantum (MQ) excitation in half-integral quadrupolar systems.

Based on this approach, alternate schemes that involve non-equilibrium spin states are proposed for improving the sensitivity of MQ experiments in spin 3/2 and 5/2 systems.

Here in this article, we revisit the important connection between “Secular-Approximation” (a well-known fundamental concept) and NMR spectroscopy. Employing recent experimental results as the background, an alternate interpretation of the secular approximation is presented for describing and understanding the nuances of Multi-Quantum (MQ) NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. Since MQ NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei forms the basis of the structural characterization of inorganic solids and clusters, we believe that the analytic theory presented herein would be beneficial both in the understanding and design of MQ NMR experiments. Additionally, the analytic results are corroborated with rigorous numerical simulations and could be employed in the quantitative interpretation of experimental results.","tags":["NMR","quadrupolar"],"title":"Understanding multi-quantum NMR through secular approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Specifically, the discussion is centered towards the treatment of selective and non-selective excitations in static quadrupolar spin (I  1/2) systems. To this end, effective radiofrequency (RF) Hamiltonians based on the spherical tensor formalism are proposed for describing transitions in both integral (I = 1, 2 and 3) and half-integral (I = 3/2, 5/2 and 7/2) quadrupolar spins. The optimum conditions desired for selective excitation in a multi-level system are derived pedagogically from first principles and presented through analytical expressions. Employing suitable model systems, the derived optimum conditions are substantiated through rigorous numerical simulations based on the spherical tensor formalism. The theory presented provides a framework for describing selective and non-selective RF pulses and could improve our understanding of multiple-pulse experiments involving quadrupolar nuclei.","tags":["NMR","quadrupolar"],"title":"Concept of effective Hamiltonians for transitions in multi-level systems ","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://DeepanshS.github.io/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
